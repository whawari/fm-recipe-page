## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use Tailwind's list and to style elements on different screen sizes using responsive utility variants

### Continued development

I am currently learning Tailwind CSS, and I plan to continue refining my skills with it for future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet](https://www.creative-tim.com/twcomponents/cheatsheet) - This helped me to quickly find Tailwind CSS classes needed for this challenge. I really liked the simplicity of the cheat sheet and will continue using it until I get a good grasp of Tailwind CSS classes.
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me to learn how to use classes specific to build this page.
